## Local setup

1. Make you have a k8s distribution installed (e.g., minikube) or reachable via your local machine (e.g., accessible with local .kube/config). 
2. Make sure you have python (>3.7) installed.
3. Run `make dep` to fetch other depdendencies, jupyter and helm.

## Notebooks

`tutorial.ipynb` contains a tutorial for building abstractions for a simple home smart space. 
> TBD rename tutorial -> home and add new space tutorials
